Turns your RSS/Atom feeds into AI-reviewed WordPress posts, with optional X and Instagram graphics.

== Description ==

AI Wire is an open-source WordPress plugin any publisher can run. It is licensed under **GPLv2 or later**.

It takes RSS or Atom feeds you configure, writes an attributed draft, runs a separate AI review, and can publish to WordPress. After an article is live, it can optionally create one branded graphic and post it to **your** X and/or Instagram accounts. Site name, desks, and the poster brand mark come from this WordPress site.

Social distribution stays off until you turn each network on. This plugin does not ship API keys. You provide:

* An OpenAI API key
* Optional X developer Keys and tokens (API Key, API Key Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret)
* Optional Instagram Professional account via your own Meta app

**Third-party services.** Article text may be sent to OpenAI for writing, review, and social images. If you enable a network, media and captions are sent to the X API and/or Instagram Graph API. Those services have their own terms and billing. Automated X posts spend X developer credits. Instagram Graph publishing has no Meta per-post fee; Meta enforces a rolling quota.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin ZIP in Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin, or copy the `technorapper-ai-wire` folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Open **AI Wire**. Save your OpenAI API key, add feeds, and set daily/monthly limits.
4. Optional: open **Social settings** and connect your X and/or Instagram accounts. Leave posting off until you are ready.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What license is this plugin? =

GPLv2 or later. See `LICENSE` in the plugin directory and https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

= Does automated X posting need paid credits? =

Yes. The plugin posts through the X API, which spends X developer credits. A Social queue error of `credits depleted` is an X console balance/spending-limit problem, not the OpenAI image budget.

= Is Instagram API posting billed per post? =

No. Instagram Graph publishing has no Meta per-post fee. Meta enforces a rolling 24-hour publishing quota. When the quota is full, the plugin leaves the item queued and tries later.

= Are my API keys in this repository? =

No. Store keys on your WordPress host. Never commit tokens to git or paste them into public issues.
